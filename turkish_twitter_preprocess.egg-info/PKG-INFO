        `ttp.preprocess_sentence("Example sentence!", stopwords)`  
        
        ## functions you can use with the package

        ### `remove_emoji(text)`
        this function should remove every emoji from the given string.
        ### `resubComma(text)`
        this function should replacecommas from the given string with whitespace.
        ### `vanish_punc(text)`

        ### `replace_emoticon(text, positive_str="SMILEYPOSITIVE", negative_str="SMILEYNEGATIVE")`
        this function should replace every emoticon from the given string as shown below.
        positive emoticon example =>`:D, :), :d` and similars are replaced with `"SMILEYPOSITIVE"` 
        negative emoticon example =>` -_-, =(, :(`and similars are replaced with `"SMILEYNEGATIVE"`
        ### `remove_emoticon(text)`
        this function should remove every emoticon from the given string.
        ### `remove_user_handle(text)`
        this function should every word that starts with '@' from the given string. we use this for removing user handles from the twitter data.
        ### `remove_digits_and_extensions(text)`
        this function should remove every digits and their extensions from the string, for example if we have a word like this `"100'de 1 sanslari yok!"`, this function would transform this into `"sanslari yok"`.

        this function should remove every digit from the given string.
        ### `remove_hashtag_and_word(text)`
        this function should remove every word that starts with '#' from the given string. we use it to remove hashtags from the twitter data because hashtags does not mean a lot to a nlp model. and hashtags are not really permanent, it can lower your accuracy score in the long run.
        ### `remove_newline_char(text)`
        this function should remove every `"\n"` character from the given string. we use it because it doesn't make any sense to use it in a nlp model.
        ### `remove_extra_spaces(text)`
        this function should remove every extra space from the given string.
        ### `dup_vanish(text)`
        this function should normalize words that contains repeated nonsense characters in it. for example this string `"boyylleeee hukumeetttinnnn gellmiisssini gecmisiniii!"` would be transformed to `"boyle hukumetin gelmisini gecmisini!"`.
        ### `preprocess_sentence(text, stopwords)`
        this function should preprocess the text with stopwords.
